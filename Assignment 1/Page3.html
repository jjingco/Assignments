                <p> I wanted to write something in every page to make it less 
                    generic and so here it goes: Relaxed to are colours that don't usually
                    pop out on the page -they are more subtle, more simple and just
                    overall easy to read. They shouldn't make your eyes too tired
                    and I think most of that should be driven by the amount of contrast on 
                    the page making sure the lettering and the background isn't too harsh
                    for the readers. Afterall, you do just want them to "relax..."
