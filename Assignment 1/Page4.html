            <p> I wanted to write something in every page to make it less 
                generic and so here it goes: After graduating university
                with my BA in Economics, one of my first jobs was a junior analyst
                for one of the now Cara-owned companies. Having one foot in finance
                under corporate planning and the other in systems through point of sales management,
                I began to realize that I had a technical side. And thus began my transition
                to a new job. Little did I know that eventually, the techy side of me 
                would win over the finance....
                Thanks for reviewing my page! Any critism is always welcomed!
            </p>
