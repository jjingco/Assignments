                <p> I wanted to write something in every page to make it less 
                    generic and so here it goes: A retro "feel" with the shawdowing, 
                    but overall the goal was to 
                    make the "Energtic" pop out to the readers. The colour strategy 
                    was analogous to convey warm. The first thought that popped into 
                    my mind when the world "energetic" was said were that of
                    fireworks lighting up the sky.  From the famous words of Einstein, 
                    "energy cannot be created or destroyed [-only transformed.]"
                    Thanks for reviewing my page! Any critism is always welcomed!
