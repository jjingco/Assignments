            <p> I wanted to write something in every page to make it less 
                generic and so here it goes: fun is laughter. It's being with
                your friends and it's the happiest moments where you don't
                necessarily know why you're laughing, but you just remember
                that that moment was just funny. It's those days where you think
                back and realized you had the worst of luck, but somehow you 
                still made friends along the way...
                Thanks for reviewing my page! Any critism is always welcomed!
